#### 3.2.3.4 Logarithms (Properties of log)

::: fragment
-   Logarithms: $log_a x$
:::

::: fragment
-   $a^{log_a x}=x$
:::

::: fragment
-   $log_a a^x=x$
:::

::: fragment
-   if $log_a x=b$, then $a^{log_ax}=a^b$, thus $x=a^b$
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: fragment
-   The base for the natural log is the $e \approx 2.7183$

Example:
:::

::: fragment
If you suspect that education increases the probability of voting in national elections, but that each additional year of education has a smaller impact on the probability of voting than the preceding year's, then the log functions are good candidates to represent that conjecture.

if $p_v$ is "probability of voting" and $ed$ is "years of education":
:::

::: fragment
-   then $p_v= \alpha + \beta ed$ specifies a linear relationship where an additional year of education has the same impact on the probability of voting regardless of how many years of education one has had.
:::

::: fragment
-   $p_v= \alpha + \beta ed^2$ represents the claim that the impact of education on the probability of voting rises the more educated one becomes.
:::

::: fragment
-   We transform the relationship between $p_v$ and $ed$ from a linear one to a nonlinear one where the impact of an additional year of education declines the more educated one becomes: $p_v= \alpha + \beta (\ln(ed))$
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: fragment
-   Algebraic rules for logs
:::

::: fragment
$$
\ln(x_1 \cdot x_2)=\ln(x_1)+\ln(x_2) \text{, for }x_1,x_2>0
$$
:::

::: fragment
$$
\ln \frac{x_1}{x_2}=\ln(x_1)-\ln(x_2) \text{, for }x_1,x_2>0
$$
:::

::: fragment
$$
\ln(x_1 + x_2) \neq \ln(x_1)+\ln(l_2) \text{, for }x_1,x_2>0
$$
:::

::: fragment
$$
\ln(x_1 - x_2) \neq \ln(x_1)-\ln(lx) \text{, for }x_1,x_2>0
$$
:::

::: fragment
$$
\ln(x^b)=b\ln(x) \text{, for } x>0
$$
:::

::: fragment
$$
\ln(1+x) \approx x \text{, for } x>0 \text{ and } x \approx 0
$$

### 3.3.1 Preference Relations

::: fragment
**Transitivity** states that if $a$ is at least as good as $b$, and $b$ is at least as good as $c$, then a is at least as good as $c$: if $aRb$ and $bRc$, then $aRc$.
:::

::: fragment
**Symmetry** states that if $aRb$, then $bRa$ for all $a$ and $b$. In the realm of preference orderings, this implies complete indifference: everything is at least as good as everything else.
:::

::: fragment
**Reflexivity**: A relation on a set $A$ is reflexive if for all $a \in A$, $aRa$ is $True$.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3.3.2 Utility Functions

::: fragment
-   Integers and the real numbers are complete and transitive for all the usual ordering relations.
:::

::: fragment
-   Thus, if we want to represent our "at least as good as" relation with numbers, this relation had better have the same properties.
:::

::: fragment
-   we can translate the relation R on any set A to a function u on the same set.
:::

::: fragment
-   This u is called a utility function and assigns a value, typically a real number, to each element in A.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4.1 SEQUENCES AND SERIES

### 4.1.1 Sequences

::: fragment
-   A **sequence** is an ordered list of numbers.
:::

::: fragment
For example,$\{1,2,3,4 \ldots \}$
:::

::: fragment
-   we can write the whole sequence in short hand as: $\{x_i\}^N_{i=1}$
:::

::: fragment
For example, $x_i=i$
:::

::: fragment
-   we can write it as $\{i\}^{\infty}_i$
:::

::: fragment
For example, the sequence$\{2,4,6 \ldots \}$ is a a subsequence of$\{1,2,3,4 \ldots \}$, which one can represent as $x_i=2i$
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4.1.2 Series

::: fragment
-   A **series** is the sum of a sequence. Put differently, a series is a sequence with addition operators between each of the elements.
:::

::: fragment
For example, $\{1+2+3+4+ \ldots \}$
:::

::: fragment
-   We can write this as $\sum^N_{i=1}x_i$ where $N= \infty$
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4.2 LIMITS

::: fragment
-   A **limit** describes the behavior of a function, sequence, or series of numbers as it approaches a given value.
:::

::: fragment
-   Knowing the limit of a function can help us determine what the rate of change of the function is, and knowing the rate of change is useful in both statistics and formal models.
:::

::: fragment
-   The limit of a sequence or a series is important for the study of game theory and other formal models, and it is also appealed to in some areas of statistics.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4.2.1 Limits and Sequences

::: fragment
-   A **limit of a sequence** $\{x_i\}$ is a number $L$ such that $\lim_{i \rightarrow \infty}x_i=L$
:::

::: fragment
-   The expression is read as "the limit of $x_i$ as $i$ approaches infinity is $L$."
:::

::: fragment
-   We say a sequence (or series, or function) **converges** if it has a finite limit, and **diverges** if it either has no limit or has a limit of $\pm \infty$.
:::

::: fragment
-   The **extreme values** of a set are the minimum and maximum values in that set. Limits differ in general from the extreme values of a sequence.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4.2.2 Limits and Series

::: fragment
-   The **limit of a series** is much like that of a sequence, except that one is looking for the sum of all elements in an infinite sequence rather than the "endpoint."
:::

::: fragment
-   If the series is $\sum^N_{i=1}x_i$, then the limit is $\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \sum^N_{i=1}x_i=S$.
:::

::: fragment
-   The limit $\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \sum^N_{i=1}i= \infty$, and so the series is divergent
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4.2.3 Limits and Functions

::: fragment
-   For the function $y=f(x)$, the **limit of the function** is the value of $y$ that the function tends toward given arbitrarily small movements toward a specific value of $x$, say $x=c$.
:::

::: fragment
-   The limit either exists or does not exist for a given value of $x$, and if it does exist we can calculate it. Formally, much as for a sequence we can write $\lim_{x \rightarrow c}f(x)=L$. One reads that notation as "the limit of $f$ of $x$ as $x$ approaches $c$ is $L$."
:::

::: fragment
-   Unlike a sequence, however, it's possible to approach a point (other than $\pm \infty$) from two different directions. If $x$ approaches $c$ from above (i.e., $x$ decreases toward $c$), then we write $\lim_{x \rightarrow c^+}f(x)=L^+$
:::

::: fragment
-   If $x$ approaches $c$ from below, we write $\lim_{x \rightarrow c^-}f(x)=L^-$.
:::

::: fragment
-   If the limits from above and below are equal, so that $L=L^+=L^-$, then the function has a unique limit at c.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: fragment
**Limit of** $f(x)=x^2 \text{ as } x \rightarrow 2$

| x    | f(x)   |
|------|--------|
| 1.9  | 3.61   |
| 1.95 | 3.8025 |
| 1.98 | 3.9204 |
| 1.99 | 3.9601 |
| 2.0  | 4      |
| 2.01 | 4.0401 |
| 2.02 | 4.0804 |
| 2.05 | 4.2025 |
| 2.1  | 4.41   |
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Some properties of limits:**

::: fragment
-   In the situation in which the value of the function is undefined at $c$ example:

let $f=\frac{x^2-4}{x-2}$. This function is undefined at $x=2$.

One way is to factor the numerator into$(x+2)(x-2)$,

and then divide the numerator and denominator by$(x-2)$.

Canceling the$(x-2)$ leaves $x+2$, which approaches $4$ from above and below as $x \rightarrow 2$
:::

::: fragment
-   Even when the numerator and denominator of a rational function do not cancel, one can still use the same approach when the limit is $x \rightarrow \infty$ and the numerator and denominator of the function both go to $\infty$ as well. In this case, just pick the terms on both bottom and top that are the biggest for any finite value of x, and then cancel common terms as above.
:::

::: fragment
Example:

The limit of $f= \frac{x^3+2x^2}{3x^3+2x-1}$ as $x \rightarrow \infty$ is $\frac{1}{3}$
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4.3 OPEN,CLOSED,COMPACT,ANDCONVEXSETS

```{=html}

  font-weight: bold;
}
</style>
```
::: fragment
-   An **open set** is one in which there is some distance (which may be arbitrarily small) that you may move in any direction within the set and stay in the set.
:::

::: fragment
![](fig4.3.1.png)
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: fragment
-   A **closed set** is one that contains all its limit points.
:::

::: fragment
![](fig4.3.2.png)
:::

::: fragment
-   A set that is not closed, in contrast, can have the point the sequence approaches --- the set's **limit point** --- outside the set, even if all prior points in the sequence are in the set.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: fragment
-   The set contains all its limit points and can itself be contained within some finite boundary---is called **compact**.
:::

::: fragment
![](fig4.3.3.png)
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: fragment
-   A subset of [R]{.outline}<sup>n</sup> for which every pair of points in the set is joined by a straight line that is also in the set is called a **convex set**. Formally, a set is convex if for all points $x$ and $y$ in it and all $\lambda \in [0,1]$, the point $(1-\lambda)x+\lambda y$ is also in the set.
:::

::: fragment
![](fig4.3.4.png)
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: fragment
-   The **convex hull** of a set $A$ is the set $A$ plus all the points needed to make A convex.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4.4 CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS

::: fragment
-   A **continuous function** is a function without sudden breaks in it.
:::

::: fragment
-   The graph of a **discontinuous function** has at least one break in it.
:::

::: fragment
-   A continuous function is one for which an arbitrarily small change in x causes an arbitrarily small change in y for all values of x.
:::

::: fragment
Example:

Function$f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ is not continuous over domain [R]{.outline}.
:::
