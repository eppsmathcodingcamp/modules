## 4.1 SEQUENCES AND SERIES

### 4.1.1 Sequences

::: fragment
-   A **sequence** is an ordered list of numbers.
:::

::: fragment
For example,$\{1,2,3,4 \ldots \}$
:::

::: fragment
-   we can write the whole sequence in short hand as: $\{x_i\}^N_{i=1}$
:::

::: fragment
For example, $x_i=i$
:::

::: fragment
-   we can write it as $\{i\}^{\infty}_i=1$
:::

::: fragment
For example, the sequence$\{2,4,6 \ldots \}$ is a a subsequence of$\{1,2,3,4 \ldots \}$, which one can represent as $x_i=2i$
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4.1.2 Series

::: fragment
-   A **series** is the sum of a sequence. Put differently, a series is a sequence with addition operators between each of the elements.
:::

::: fragment
For example, $\{1+2+3+4+ \ldots \}$
:::

::: fragment
-   We can write this as $\sum^N_{i=1}x_i$ where $N= \infty$
:::

## 4.2 LIMITS

::: fragment
-   A **limit** describes the behavior of a function, sequence, or series of numbers as it approaches a given value.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4.2.1 Limits and Sequences

::: fragment
-   A **limit of a sequence** $\{x_i\}$ is a number $L$ such that $\lim_{i \rightarrow \infty}x_i=L$
:::

::: fragment
-   The expression is read as "the limit of $x_i$ as $i$ approaches infinity is $L$."
:::

::: fragment
-   We say a sequence (or series, or function) **converges** if it has a finite limit, and **diverges** if it either has no limit or has a limit of $\pm \infty$.
:::

::: fragment
-   The **extreme values** of a set are the minimum and maximum values in that set. Limits differ in general from the extreme values of a sequence.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4.2.2 Limits and Series

::: fragment
-   The \*\*limit of a series is much like that of a sequence, except that one is looking for the sum of all elements in an infinite sequence rather than the "endpoint."
:::

::: fragment
-   If the series is $\sum^N_{i=1}x_i$, then the limit is $\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \sum^N_{i=1}x_i=S$.
:::

::: fragment
-   The limit $\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \sum^N_{i=1}i= \infty$, and so the series is divergent
:::

::: fragment
-   An **open set** is one in which there is some distance (which may be arbitrarily small) that you may move in any direction within the set and stay in the set.
:::

::: fragment
-   A **closed set** is one that contains all its limit points.
:::

::: fragment
-   A set that is not closed, in contrast, can have the point the sequence approaches --- the set's **limit point** --- outside the set, even if all prior points in the sequence are in the set.
:::

::: fragment
-   The set contains all its limit points and can itself be contained within some finite boundary---is called **compact**.
:::

::: fragment
-   A subset of [R]{.outline}<sup>n</sup> for which every pair of points in the set is joined by a straight line that is also in the set is called a **convex set**. Formally, a set is convex if for all points $x$ and $y$ in it and all $\lambda \in [0,1]$, the point $(1-\lambda)x+\lambda y$ is also in the set.
:::

::: fragment
-   The **convex hull** of a set $A$ is the set $A$ plus all the points needed to make A convex.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4.4 CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS

::: fragment
-   A **continuous function** is a function without sudden breaks in it.
:::

::: fragment
-   The graph of a **discontinuous function** has at least one break in it.
:::

::: fragment
-   A continuous function is one for which an arbitrarily small change in x causes an arbitrarily small change in y for all values of x.
:::

::: fragment
Example:

Function$f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ is not continuous over domain [R]{.outline}.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4.2.3 Limits and Functions

::: fragment
-   For the function $y=f(x)$, the **limit of the function** is the value of $y$ that the function tends toward given arbitrarily small movements toward a specific value of $x$, say $x=c$.
:::

::: fragment
-   The limit either exists or does not exist for a given value of $x$, and if it does exist we can calculate it. Formally, much as for a sequence we can write $\lim_{x \rightarrow c}f(x)=L$. One reads that notation as "the limit of $f$ of $x$ as $x$ approaches $c$ is $L$."
:::

::: fragment
-   Unlike a sequence, however, it's possible to approach a point (other than $\pm \infty$) from two different directions. If $x$ approaches $c$ from above (i.e., $x$ decreases toward $c$), then we write $\lim_{x \rightarrow c^+}f(x)=L^+$
:::

::: fragment
-   If $x$ approaches $c$ from below, we write $\lim_{x \rightarrow c^-}f(x)=L^-$.
:::

::: fragment
-   If the limits from above and below are equal, so that $L=L^+=L^-$, then the function has a unique limit at c.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: fragment
| x    | f(x)   |
|------|--------|
| 1.9  | 3.61   |
| 1.95 | 3.8025 |
| 1.98 | 3.9204 |
| 1.99 | 3.9601 |
| 2.0  | 4      |
| 2.01 | 4.0401 |
| 2.02 | 4.0804 |
| 2.05 | 4.2025 |
| 2.1  | 4.41   |
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Some properties of limits:**

::: fragment
-   In the situation in which the value of the function is undefined at $c$ example:

let $f=\frac{x^2-4}{x-2}$. This function is undefined at $x=2$.

One way is to factor the numerator into$(x+2)(x-2)$,

and then divide the numerator and denominator by$(x-2)$.

Canceling the$(x-2)$ leaves $x+2$, which approaches $4$ from above and below as $x \rightarrow 2$
:::

::: fragment
-   Even when the numerator and denominator of a rational function do not cancel, one can still use the same approach when the limit is $x \rightarrow \infty$ and the numerator and denominator of the function both go to $\infty$ as well. In this case, just pick the terms on both bottom and top that are the biggest for any finite value of x, and then cancel common terms as above.
:::

::: fragment
Example:

The limit of $f= \frac{x^3+2x^2}{3x^3+2x-1}$ as $x \rightarrow \infty$ is $\frac{1}{3}$
