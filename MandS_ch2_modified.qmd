## 2.1 BASIC PROPERTIES OF ARITHMETIC

The **associative properties** state that $(a+b)+c = a+(b+c)$ and $(a \times b) \times c = a \times (b \times c)$.

The **commutative properties** state that $a+b=b+1$ and $a \times b=b \times a$.

The **distributive property** states that $a(b+c)=ab+ac$.

The **identity properties** state that there exists a zero such that $x+0=x$ and that there exists a one such that $x \times 1 =x$.

The **inverse property** states that there exists a $-x$ such that $(x)+x=0$. We might also consider an inverse under multiplication, $x^{-1}$, such that $(x^{-1} \times x) = 1$. <br>

The existence of this inverse is aproperty of the real numbers (and the rational numbers), but not the integers.

### 2.1.1 Order of Operations

parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction <br>

A common mnemonic device people use to memorize order of operations is <br>

PEMDAS <br>

or <u>P</u>lease <u>E</u>xcuse <u>M</u>y <u>D</u>ear <u>A</u>unt <u>S</u>ally.

<br>

### 2.1.2 Ratios, Proportions, and Percentages

The **ratio** of two quantities is one divided by the other $\frac{x}{y}$ is the ratio of x to y. Ratios are also written as $x:y$. <br>

Though a ratio may be negative, we typically consider ratio variables that range from $0$ to $\infty$. <br>

The **proportion** of two variables, on the other hand, is the amount one vari able represents of the sum of itself and a second variable: $|\frac{x}{x+y}|$. <br>

A proportion ranges from a minimum of $0$ to a maximum of $1$. <br>

The proportion of expenditures that is spent in a given category is often interested. <br>

The **percentage** one variable represents of a total is the proportion represented over the range from $0$ to $100$: $|\frac{x}{x+y}| \times 100 \%$ <br>

Many people find a percentage representation more intuitive than a proportion representation. <br>

You will also encounter the **percentage change** in a variable, which is calculated as: $\frac{x_{t+1}-x_t}{x_t}$, where the subscript $t$ indicates the first observation and the subscript t + 1 indicates the second observation.

## 2.2 ALGEBRA REVIEW

### 2.2.1 Fractions

$$ 
\frac{Numerator}{Denominator}
$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2.2.2 Factoring

Factoring involves rearranging the terms in an equation to make further manipulation possible or to reveal something of interest. <br>

Example:<br> $$ \delta+\delta^2+4\delta-6\delta^2+18\delta^3$$ In this case we combine all the terms that have the same exponent, which gives us $$ 18\delta^3-5\delta^2+5\delta$$

#### 2.2.2.1 Factoring Quadratic Polynomials

Quadratic polynomials are composed of a constant and a variable that is both squared and raised to the power of one: $x^2-2x+3$, or $7-12x+6x^2$. Quadratic polynomials can be factored into the product of two terms: $(x \pm ?) \times (x \pm ?)$ where you need to determine whether the sign is $+$ or $-$, and then replace the question marks with the proper values.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 2.2.2.2 Factoring and Fractions

Consider the fraction $\frac{x^2-1}{x-1}$ <br> We can factor the numerator $x^2-1=(x+1)(x-1)$. We can thus rewrite the fraction as follows: $$
\frac{x^2-1}{x-1}=
\frac{(x+1)(x-1)}{x-1}
$$ The term $x-1$ is in both the numerator and the denominator and thus (as long as $x\neq 1$) cancels out, leaving $x+1$ for $x \neq 1$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2.2.3 Expansion: The FOIL Method

$$
(\delta + \gamma)^2 \\
=(\delta + \gamma)(\delta + \gamma) \\
=\delta^2 + 2\delta\gamma + \gamma^2
$$ F: Multiply the first terms: $(\underline{2\pi}+7) (\underline{4}+3\pi)=2 \pi \times 4=8 \pi$ <br>

O: Multiply the outer terms: $(\underline{2\pi}+7) (4+\underline{3\pi})=2 \pi \times 3 \pi=6 \pi^2$ <br>

I: Multiply the inner terms: $(2\pi+\underline{7}) (\underline{4}+3\pi)=4 \times 7=28$ <br>

L: Multiply the last terms: $(2\pi+\underline{7}) (4+\underline{3\pi})=7 \times 3 \pi=21 \pi$ <br>

Add terms to get: $8\pi+6\pi^2+28+21\pi$ <br>

Finally, group like terms to get: $6\pi^2+29\pi+28$ <br>

To test yourself, factor the final expression and show it yields the simplified expression with which we started. This is one way to check your work for any careless mistakes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 2.2.4.1 Solving Quadratics

Example: $$
(x-3)^2=4 \\
x-3=\pm 2 \\
x=5 \text{ or } x=1
$$

Note that this quadratic equation will have two solutions in the real numbers, or zero, but not one. In other words, the cardinality of the solution set for a quadratic equation will be zero or two. <br>

Example with no solutions in the real numbers: $x^2+1=0$ <br>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another example: $$
x^2+8x+6=0
$$ ---

The general form of a quadratic equation: <br> $$
ax^2+bx+c=0
$$ The general solutions to this equation: $$
x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exercise:

$$
1.4x^2+3.7x+1.1=0   
$$ ---

Answer:

$$
a=1.4, b=3.7, c=1.1 \\
x=\frac{-3.7 \pm \sqrt{3.7^2-4 \times 1.4 \times 1.1}}{2.8}
$$ Using a calculator to solve, we find that $x=-.341 \text{ or } x=-2.301$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2.2.5 Inequalities

-   All pairs of real numbers have exactly one of the following relations: $x=y$, $x>y$, or $x<y$.

-   Adding any number to each side of these relations will not change them; this includes the inequalities.<br> That is, inequalities have the same addition and subtraction properties as equalities such that: if $x>y$, then $x+a>y+a$ and $x-a>y-a$

-   You flip the $<$ or $>$ sign when multiplying or dividing by a negative. Multiplying or dividing an inequality by zero is not allowed.

For multiplication, if $a$ is positive and $x>y$, then $ax>ay$. <br> If $a$ is negative and $x>y$, then $ax<ay$. <br> For division, if $a$ is positive and $x>y$, then $\frac{x}{a}>\frac{y}{a}$. <br> If $a$ is negative and $x>y$, then $\frac{x}{a}<\frac{y}{a}$. <br>

Example: <br> Solve for $y$: <br> $$
-4y>2x+12 \\
y<-\frac{x}{2}-3 \\
$$
