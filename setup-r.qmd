## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the world of data science! This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your data science environment using R and RStudio. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully functional setup ready for your data science journey.

## 2. Installing R

R is the programming language we'll be using for data analysis. Let's start by installing it on your system.

### For Windows:

1. Go to the [R Project website](https://cran.r-project.org/).
2. Click on "Download R for Windows".
3. Click on "base".
4. Click on the download link for the latest version of R.
5. Once downloaded, run the installer and follow the prompts.

### For Mac:

1. Go to the [R Project website](https://cran.r-project.org/).
2. Click on "Download R for macOS".
3. Click on the `.pkg` file appropriate for your macOS version.
4. Once downloaded, open the `.pkg` file and follow the installation instructions.

::: {.callout-important}
**Exercise 1:** After installation, type `R.version`. What version of R did you install? What is the nickname of that particular software build? 
:::

## 3. Installing RStudio

RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that makes working with R much easier and more efficient.

::: {.callout-tip}
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that helps programmers develop software code more efficiently. IDEs combine capabilities like software editing, building, testing, and packaging into a single, easy-to-use application. When choosing an IDE, you can consider things like cost, supported languages, and extensibility. For example, if you're currently a Python developer but might start learning Ruby in the future, you might want to find an IDE that supports both languages.
:::

### For both Windows and Mac:

1. Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
2. Under the "RStudio Desktop" section, click on "Download".
3. Select the appropriate installer for your operating system.
4. Once downloaded, run the installer and follow the prompts.

::: {.callout-important}
**Exercise 2:** Open RStudio. In the console pane (usually at the bottom-left), type `1 + 1` and press Enter. What result do you get?
:::

## 4. Configuring RStudio

Let's set up some basic configurations in RStudio to enhance your workflow.

1. In RStudio, go to Tools > Global Options.
2. Under the "General" tab:
   - Uncheck "Restore .RData into workspace at startup"
   - Set "Save workspace to .RData on exit" to "Never"
3. Under the "Code" tab:
   - Check "Soft-wrap R source files"
4. Click "Apply" and then "OK".

::: {.callout-important}
**Exercise 3:** Create a new R script (File > New File > R Script). Type `print("Hello, Data Science!")` and run the code. What output do you see in the console?
:::


## 5. Installing a Package Manager (pacman)

::: {.callout-tip}
In R, a package is a collection of R functions, data, and compiled code that's organized in a standard format.
:::

Pacman is a convenient package manager for R. Let's install it and learn how to use it.

In the RStudio console, type:

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("pacman")
```

Once installed, you can load pacman and use it to install and load other packages:

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(pacman)
p_load(dplyr, ggplot2)
```

This installs (if necessary) and loads the dplyr and ggplot2 packages.


::: {.callout-important}
**Exercise 4:** Use pacman to install and load the tidyr package. Then, use p_functions() to list all functions in the tidyr package.
:::

## Setting Up Your Working Directory

Setting up a proper working directory is crucial for organizing your projects.

For Windows:

- In RStudio, go to Session > Set Working Directory > Choose Directory

For Mac:

- In RStudio, go to Session > Set Working Directory > Choose Directory

### Alternatively, you can set the working directory using code:

```{r}
#| eval: false
setwd("/path/to/your/directory")
```

::: {.callout-important}
**Exercise 5:** Create a new folder on your computer called "DataScience". Set this as your working directory in RStudio. Then, use getwd() to confirm it's set correctly.

## 7. Essential R Commands and Packages

Let's familiarize ourselves with some essential R commands and set up the main packages you'll need for data science work.

### 7.1 Basic R Commands


```{r}
#| eval: false
# Creating variables
x <- 5
y <- 10

# Basic arithmetic
z <- x + y

# Creating vectors
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
names <- c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie")

# Creating a data frame
df <- data.frame(
  name = names,
  age = c(25, 30, 35)
)

# Viewing data
View(df)
head(df)
str(df)
summary(df)

# Indexing
numbers[2]  # Second element
df$name     # Name column

# Basic functions
mean(numbers)
sum(numbers)
length(numbers)

# Logical operators
x > y
x == y
x != y

# Control structures
if (x > y) {
  print("x is greater than y")
} else {
  print("x is not greater than y")
}

# Loops
for (i in 1:5) {
  print(i^2)
}

# Creating a function
square <- function(x) {
  return(x^2)
}
square(4)

# Getting help
?mean
```



## Installing and Loading Essential Packages

Let's install and load some of the most commonly used packages in data science:

```{r}
#| eval: false

# Install and load essential packages
p_load(
  tidyverse,   # a collection of packages for data science, including ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, and more
  readxl,      # for reading Excel files
  lubridate,   # for working with dates (technically part of tidyverse, but not loaded automatically)
  haven,       # for reading and writing data from SPSS, Stata, and SAS
  survey,      # for complex survey analysis
  lme4,        # for linear and generalized linear mixed models
