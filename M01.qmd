## Variables and Constants

::: fragment
-   Definition and Examples

In research, variables are characteristics that can be measured and manipulated, such as temperature in a climate study, while constants are factors kept unchanged, like standard atmospheric pressure in the same study" (Creswell & Creswell, 2017).

:::

::: fragment
-   Subsets and Supersets: A is a subset of B (A ⊆ B) if every element of A is also in B; B is then a superset of A.

## Sets

## Examples

### Summation and Multiplication in Practice

::: fragment
Consider the following sets of values for $x_i$:

-   $x_1 = 2$
-   $x_2 = 4$
-   $x_3 = 6$
:::

::: fragment
**Summation:** $$ \sum_{i=1}^{3} x_i = 2 + 4 + 6 = 12 $$
:::

::: fragment
**Multiplication:** $$ \prod_{i=1}^{3} x_i = 2 \times 4 \times 6 = 48 $$

## Exercise 1: Properties of Sets

### Question 5

Consider the sets $A = \{1, 5, 10\}$ and $B = \{1, 2, \ldots, 10\}$.

1.  Is $A \subset B$, $B \subset A$, both, or neither?
2.  What is $A \cup B$?
3.  What is $A \cap B$?
4.  Partition $B$ into two sets, $A$ and everything else. Call everything else $C$. What is $C$?
5.  What is $A \cup C$?
6.  What is $A \cap C$?

## Exercise 1: Properties of Sets

### Solution

1.  $A \subset B$
2.  $A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}$
3.  $A \cap B = \{1, 5, 10\}$
4.  $C = B \setminus A = \{2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$
5.  $A \cup C = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}$
6.  $A \cap C = \emptyset$ :::

## Exercise 2: Cartesian Product

### Question 6

Write an element of the Cartesian product $[0, 1] \times (1, 2)$.

## Exercise 2: Cartesian Product

### Solution

An element of the Cartesian product $[0, 1] \times (1, 2)$ is $(x, y)$ where $x \in [0, 1]$ and $y \in (1, 2)$.

Example: $(0.5, 1.5)$ :::

## Exercise 3: Irrational Numbers

### Question 7

Prove that $\sqrt{2}$ is an irrational number. That is, show that it cannot be written as the ratio of two integers, $p$ and $q$.

## Exercise 3: Irrational Numbers

### Solution

Assume $\sqrt{2}$ is rational, meaning it can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$ where $p$ and $q$ are coprime integers (no common factors other than 1).

$$
\sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q} \implies 2 = \frac{p^2}{q^2} \implies 2q^2 = p^2
$$

This implies $p^2$ is even, so $p$ must be even. Let $p = 2k$ for some integer $k$.

$$
2q^2 = (2k)^2 \implies 2q^2 = 4k^2 \implies q^2 = 2k^2
$$

This implies $q^2$ is even, so $q$ must be even. But if $p$ and $q$ are both even, they have a common factor of 2, contradicting the assumption that they are coprime.

Therefore, $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational. :::

## Exercise 4: Even and Odd Numbers

### Question 8

Prove that: 1. The sum of any two even numbers is even. 2. The sum of any two odd numbers is even. 3. The sum of any odd number with any even number is odd.

## Exercise 4: Even and Odd Numbers

### Solution

1.  Let $a$ and $b$ be even numbers. Then $a = 2m$ and $b = 2n$ for some integers $m$ and $n$. $$
    a + b = 2m + 2n = 2(m + n)
    $$ Since $m + n$ is an integer, $a + b$ is even.

2.  Let $a$ and $b$ be odd numbers. Then $a = 2m + 1$ and $b = 2n + 1$ for some integers $m$ and $n$. $$
    a + b = (2m + 1) + (2n + 1) = 2m + 2n + 2 = 2(m + n + 1)
    $$ Since $m + n + 1$ is an integer, $a + b$ is even.

3.  Let $a$ be an odd number and $b$ be an even number. Then $a = 2m + 1$ and $b = 2n$ for some integers $m$ and $n$. $$
    a + b = (2m + 1) + 2n = 2m + 2n + 1 = 2(m + n) + 1
    $$ Since $m + n$ is an integer, $a + b$ is odd. :::
