## 3.1 FUNCTIONS

::: fragment
-   A relation that assigns one element of the range to each element of the domain is a **function**.
:::

::: fragment
-   One that assigns a subset of the range to each element of the domain is a **correspondence**.

### 3.1.1 Equations

::: fragment
-   **implicit** notation $$
    y=f(x)
    $$
:::

::: fragment
-   **explicit** notation

Example: $y=3x$

$y$ is a function of $x$;<br> $x$ is the argument of the function

### 3.1.3 Some Properties of Functions

::: fragment
-   We define the function $f$ as $f(x) : A \rightarrow B$. This is often read as "$f$ maps $A$ into $B$." $A$ here is the **domain** of the function, $B$ is known as the **codomain**.
:::

::: fragment
-   The set of all values actually reached by running each $x \in A$ through $f$ is known as the **image**, or **range**, and it is necessarily a subset of **B**.
:::

::: fragment
-   **function composition**: $g \circ f(x)$ or $g(f(x))$

#### 3.1.3.1 Identity and Inverse Functions

::: fragment
| Term                   | Meaning                                                                      |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Identity function      | Elements in domain are mapped to identical elements in codomain              |
| Inverse function       | Function that when composed with original function returns identity function |
| Surjective (onto)      | Every value in codomain produced by value in domain                          |
| Injective (one-to-one) | Each value in range comes from only one value in domain                      |
| Bijective (invertible) | Both surjective and injective; function has an inverse                       |

### 3.2.1 The Linear Equation (Affine Function)

::: fragment
-   $y=a+bx$
:::

::: fragment
-   A **linear equation** is an equation that contains only terms of order $x^1$ and $x^0=1$. In other words, only $x$ and $1$, multiplied by constants, may appear on the right-hand side (RHS) of a linear equation.
:::

::: fragment
### 3.2.2 Linear Functions
:::

::: fragment
-   Additivity: $f(x_1+x_2)=f(x_1)+f(x_2)$
:::

::: fragment
-   Scaling (aka homogeneity):$f(ax)=af(x), \text{for all a}$.
:::

::: fragment
-   **Linear functions** are not affine functions, e.g., they do not permit a translation(the $x^0$ term).

### 3.2.3 Nonlinear Functions:

#### 3.2.3.2 Quadratic Functions

y=\alpha +\beta_1x+\beta_2x^2
$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 3.2.3.4 Logarithms (Properties of log)

::: fragment
-   Logarithms: $log_a x$
:::

::: fragment
-   $a^{log_a x}=x$
:::

::: fragment
-   $log_a a^x=x$
:::

::: fragment
-   if $log_a x=b$, then $a^{log_ax}=a^b$, thus $x=a^b$
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: fragment
-   The base for the natural log is the $e \approx 2.7183$
:::

::: fragment
Example:
:::

::: fragment
If you suspect that education increases the probability of voting in national elections, but that each additional year of education has a smaller impact on the probability of voting than the preceding year's, then the log functions are good candidates to represent that conjecture.

if $p_v$ is "probability of voting" and $ed$ is "years of education":
:::

::: fragment
-   then $p_v= \alpha + \beta ed$ specifies a linear relationship where an additional year of education has the same impact on the probability of voting regardless of how many years of education one has had.
:::

::: fragment
-   $p_v= \alpha + \beta ed^2$ represents the claim that the impact of education on the probability of voting rises the more educated one becomes.
:::

::: fragment
-   We transform the relationship between $p_v$ and $ed$ from a linear one to a nonlinear one where the impact of an additional year of education declines the more educated one becomes: $p_v= \alpha + \beta (\ln(ed))$
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: fragment
-   Algebraic rules for logs
:::

::: fragment
$$
\ln(x_1 \cdot x_2)=\ln(x_1)+\ln(x_2) \text{, for }x_1,x_2>0
$$
:::

::: fragment
$$
\ln \frac{x_1}{x_2}=\ln(x_1)-\ln(x_2) \text{, for }x_1,x_2>0
$$
:::

::: fragment
$$
\ln(x_1 + x_2) \neq \ln(x_1)+\ln(l_2) \text{, for }x_1,x_2>0
$$
:::

::: fragment
$$
\ln(x_1 - x_2) \neq \ln(x_1)-\ln(lx) \text{, for }x_1,x_2>0
$$
:::

::: fragment
$$
\ln(x^b)=b\ln(x) \text{, for } x>0
$$
:::

::: fragment
$$
\ln(1+x) \approx x \text{, for } x>0 \text{ and } x \approx 0
$$
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3.3.1 Preference Relations

::: fragment
**Transitivity** states that if $a$ is at least as good as $b$, and $b$ is at least as good as $c$, then a is at least as good as $c$: if $aRb$ and $bRc$, then $aRc$.
:::

::: fragment
**Symmetry** states that if $aRb$, then $bRa$ for all $a$ and $b$. In the realm of preference orderings, this implies complete indifference: everything is at least as good as everything else.
:::

::: fragment
**Reflexivity**: A relation on a set $A$ is reflexive if for all $a \in A$, $aRa$ is $True$.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3.3.2 Utility Functions

::: fragment
-   Integers and the real numbers are complete and transitive for all the usual ordering relations.
:::

::: fragment
-   Thus, if we want to represent our "at least as good as" relation with numbers, this relation had better have the same properties.
:::

::: fragment
-   we can translate the relation R on any set A to a function u on the same set.
:::

::: fragment
-   This u is called a utility function and assigns a value, typically a real number, to each element in A.
:::

## Problems

### Problem 1

If the domain of the function $y = 5 + 3x$ is the set $\{x \mid 1 < x < 4\}$, find the range of the function and express it as a set.

### Problem 2

For the function $y = -x^2$, if the domain is the set of all nonnegative real numbers, what will its range be?

### Problem 3

Graph the functions:

(a) $y = -x^2 + 5x - 2$

(b) $y = x^2 + 5x - 2$

with the set of values $-5 < x < 5$ as the domain. It is well known that the sign of the coefficient of the $x^2$ term determines whether the graph of a quadratic function will have a "hill" or a "valley." On the basis of the present problem, which sign is associated with the hill? Supply an intuitive explanation for this.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Problem 4

Graph the function $y = \frac{36}{x}$, assuming that $x$ and $y$ can take positive values only. Next, suppose that both variables can take negative values as well; how must the graph be modified to reflect this change in assumption?

### Problem 5

Simplify $\frac{x^3}{x-3}$.

### Problem 6

Show that $x^{m/n} = \sqrt[n]{x^m} = (\sqrt[n]{x})^m$.

### Problem 7

Simplify $h(x) = g(f(x))$, where $f(x) = x^2 + 2$ and $g(x) = px - 4$.

### Problem 8

Simplify $h(x) = f(g(x))$ with the same $f$ and $g$. Is it the same as your previous answer?
